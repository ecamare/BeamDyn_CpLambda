Test 1: Straight box beam - only diagonal terms - static tip load

Test 2: Curved box beam - only diagonal terms - static tip load

Test 3: Straight box beam - some non-diagonal terms - static tip load

Test 4: Straight box beam - full stiffness matrix - static tip load

Test 5: Test 1 rotating around x

Test 6: Test 2 rotating around x

Test 7: Test 2 rotating around x with prebend instead of sweep

Test 8: BAR3 blade with prebend and sweep

Test 9: Composite curved beam - distributed load

Test 10: Test 4 rotating around x
